Switzerland is not only geographically located in the middle of Europe. Accordingly, its historical development is similar to that of its neighboring countries. The territory of Switzerland was part of the Roman Empire and was shaped in the early Middle Ages by Christianity, the migration of peoples and the rule of various nations. In the late Middle Ages, the so-called “Old Swiss Confederacy” gradually developed into the precursor structure of modern-day Switzerland.

The Reformation and the division of Western Christianity led to tensions and armed conflicts in Switzerland, as in many other parts of Europe. At the same time, Switzerland's neutrality developed a characteristic that still exists today.

Neutrality could not prevent the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars from also affecting Switzerland. In the “Helvetic Republic” created by the French occupation, today's borders were defined and closely connected areas became independent cantons. The modern federal state then developed out of this experience.

The 20th century also clearly shows how strongly Switzerland was connected to its neighboring countries on the one hand, and how it went its own way on the other. Although Switzerland was also severely affected by the two world wars, it was spared destruction. During the Cold War, Switzerland developed in a similar way to Western Europe, but was able to maintain its neutrality and mediating role between East and West. After the end of the Cold War, Switzerland continued to participate in the economic unification of Europe, but kept its distance from the European Union.
