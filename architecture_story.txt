Architectural design in software plays a pivotal role in building robust, scalable systems. Among various paradigms, the microkernel architecture stands out for its simplicity and flexibility. This design minimizes the core functionality, handling only essential tasks like resource management and communication. Additional features are modularized as plugins or extensions, allowing for easy updates and fault isolation.

This architecture is widely used in operating systems like Minix and QNX and modern applications requiring extensibility. Its modularity ensures that failures in one component do not affect others. By embracing a microkernel design, developers achieve a balance between innovation and system stability.
